# AI-Final-project
#This project explores the potential of multi-agent search algorithms in competitive environments, specifically optimizing the performance of iRobots in a room-cleaning task. The problem involves designing autonomous agents (iRobots) to navigate and clean a shared space efficiently, minimizing redundant actions while maximizing overall cleaning performance. This setup reflects real-world scenarios such as household cleaning and emphasizes the strategic dynamics of multi-agent systems, a growing area in robotics and artificial intelligence.

#To address this challenge, we employed the Minimax algorithm enhanced with Alpha-Beta pruning and integrated a Q-Learning approach for adaptive decision-making. Additionally, we implemented a time management system to ensure that the robots perform their tasks efficiently and make timely decisions.
